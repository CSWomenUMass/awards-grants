Dear CS Women,

We are sorry to inform you that NCWIT has not selected the University of Massachusetts Amherst's Computer Science Women's Group to receive the Symantec Student Seed Fund grant. There were many great submissions and we wish we could fund all of them.

Attached is our next call for proposals for NCWIT Academic Alliance Symantec Student Seed Fund, due March 30, 2014. We encourage you to review and revise your submission based on the below reviewer feedback and re-submit it prior to March 30, 2014.

Reviewer feedback specific to your proposal: 1) Assessment also needs to assess the event itself 2) The proposal is for a career preparation event to be held for a five college consortium. The assessment plan includes a post-event survey and a final survey. It is unclear how these will be conducted such that an adequate return rate will be gotten. 3) The event will serve a large group of students and provide valuable time and feedback on career preparation. Could consider consolidating the pre and post surveys into one offered at the end asking about change in attitudes.

If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact the NCWIT Academic Alliance program manager, Kim Kalahar at academic@ncwit.org.

On behalf of NCWIT, thank you for your efforts. We wish you the best of luck with your program.
