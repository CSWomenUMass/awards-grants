Dear CS Women,

Congratulations! We are pleased to inform you that NCWIT has selected the University of Massachusetts Amherst's CS Women to receive the NCWIT Student Seed Fund gift sponsored by Symantec! The winners have been publicly announced on our NCWIT Student Seed Fund webpage and you should check back there for the press release later this spring.

Reviewers have provided feedback specific to your proposal that you may want to peruse:

1. Proposed different ways to measure outcomes both based on the workshops and activities themselves and compared to similar activities that have taken place in the past. (GitHub and the flow from attendee to instructor. The budget is clear and well presented.

2. Although I'd like to think the topics being covered would be part of the core curriculum, I understand that may not be the case. I suspect our students would also benefit from such a series. I think building confidence in these skills is particularly important for students that may not come to CS with a strong hacker background, if any at all. I would encourage you to use targeted promotion of the event to try and have higher percentages of women attendees than are probably found in your total target population.

3. Organizers have gathered information from students on topics of interest, based it on other successful workshops, and incorporated a planning retreat to ensure best practices in teaching. The proposal is well-thought out and organized, responding to the needs of their institution.
